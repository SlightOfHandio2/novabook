# Instructions for Running Locally

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`

## Notes

### Test Coverage
Test requirements weren't included in the spec, however, I decided to include some basic ones to ensure the function of the application. If this were a "real" application, tests would have greater coverage as well as be more separated and make use of their own DB / environment.

### Database
I only chose SQLite for ease of use as a technical test example. In reality, I would choose something like PostgreSQL, but I felt this was more than suitable for the example.
